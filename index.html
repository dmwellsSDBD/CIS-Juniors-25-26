        <h1>My First HTML File</h1>

        <p>My name is David Wells, I am learning HTML for the first time.</p>
        <p>HTML - Stands for Hypertext-Markup Language. This is the language used to DESCRIBE your content.</p>
        <p>Eventually, I will learn CSS - which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This is the language used to design web pages.</p>
        <p>JavaScript, IS NOT JAVA, is a scripting language used to create interactivity on the web.</p>
